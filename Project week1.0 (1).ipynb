    "This final project explores the best locations for a Italian restaurants through the city of New York. As per the current situation that all of us are living with the COVID-19, maybe is a beat risky to invest and open a new restaurant, for this reason my client wants to know how many Italian restaurants there are today and analyze if it would be a good decision, but as New York is the most diverse city in the world (800 languages are spoken in New York), it has a long tradition of different ethnical restaurants.\n",
    "Opening a new restaurant requires serious considerations and is more complicated than it seems from the first glance. In particular, the location of the restaurant is one of the most important factors that will affect whether it will have success or a failure. So our project will attempt to answer the questions “Where should the investor open a Italian Restaurant?” and “Where should I go If I want great Italian food?”"
